# Tennis Reservation System
The system was developed as a project for InQool intership. It provides
REST api endpoints for CRUD operations on Reservations and indiviual TennisCourts.
## Setting up
The project was build with maven. Upon compiling, the application starts blank.
To prevent this, the application can be run with `--init` argument. With this argument, the application will generate and insert 2 CourtTypes and 4 TennisCourts into the database.
